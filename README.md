# Gesture 💌

**Gesture** is a simple mobile app for couples to stay connected through small but meaningful messages. The app lets partners schedule personalized text messages—called *gestures*—that are delivered as real SMS, while also gently nudging users to show up for their partner in real life.

## ❤️ Why Gesture?

Big romantic gestures are nice, but it's the small daily ones that matter. Gesture helps partners build stronger relationships through humor, consistency, and love—one message at a time.
